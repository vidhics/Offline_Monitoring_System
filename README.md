# Offline_Monitoring_System
The environmental conditions in a closed system are difficult to measure. The closed system is does not have a connection to an external environment to transmit its data in real-time. The Internet of things (IoT) is the network of physical devices, vehicles, home appliances and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and connectivity which enable these objects to connect and exchange data.  Through the use of an ESP32, it is possible to use Bluetooth to connect to the external environment. The preferred external environment shall be a smartphone running on Android or iOS operating system. The project monitors the conditions in closed systems. A closed system is defined as one where the system does not have a connection to an external environment to transmit its data in real-time. For example, monitoring the pressure inside a canister as it floats above the earthâ€™s surface. For such systems, the data should be logged and when possible, downloaded from the system for further processing.
