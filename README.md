# Offline_Monitoring_System
The environmental conditions in a closed system are difficult to measure. The closed system is does not have a connection to an external environment to transmit its data in real-time. The Internet of things (IoT) is the network of physical devices, vehicles, home appliances and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and connectivity which enable these objects to connect and exchange data.  

Through the use of an ESP32, it is possible to use Bluetooth to connect to the external environment. The preferred external environment shall be a smartphone running on Android or iOS operating system. The project monitors the conditions in closed systems. A closed system is defined as one where the system does not have a connection to an external environment to transmit its data in real-time. For example, monitoring the pressure inside a canister as it floats above the earth’s surface. For such systems, the data should be logged and when possible, downloaded from the system for further processing.

Following things are needed for these Project:

 Arduino
 Android Phone
 Cable to give power to ESP 32 from laptop/desktop.

Arduino Installation:

For Windows:
https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/master/docs/arduino-ide/windows.md

For Mac:
https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/master/docs/arduino-ide/mac.md

You may need following drives to be installed:
•	ESP32-PICO-KIT and ESP32-DevKitC - CP210x USB to UART Bridge VCP Drivers
•	ESP32-WROVER-KIT and ESP32 Demo Board - FTDI Virtual COM Port Drivers

We have attached the Arduino code and all needed libraries in the Arduino Code folder.

For Android Phone:
Install the attached .apk in the android phone.
